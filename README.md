# Welcome to FormatDesigner

FormatDesigner is an application to experiment with the format strings used to
format data in [`String.Format`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format.aspx)
and various type's [`ToString`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.iformattable.tostring.aspx)
functions.

Enjoy.

## Limitations

* This version is just an initial cut at an application like this. Ideally, the
  Format text box would be a combo box with all kinds of example formats (like
  those listed in [the Format Specifiers appendix of C# in a Nutshell, by Drayton
  et al](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpnut/chapter/appb.pdf).

## History

* 8/12/03: Atif Aziz sent along code to change the culture interactively. Thanks,
  Atif! I also took this opportunity to sort the Type field and resize the main
  window to be a bit larger for those hard to reach format strings.

* 8/6/03: Initial release (including a fix for a minimum/maximum size bug
  reported by Kevin Dente)
