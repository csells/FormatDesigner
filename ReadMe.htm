    This version is just an initial cut at an application like this. Ideally, the 
    Format text box would be a combo box with all kinds of example formats (like 
    those listed in <A target="_blank" href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpnut/chapter/appb.pdf">
      the Format Specifiers appendix of C# in a Nutshell, by Drayton et al</A>).</LI></UL>

  8/12/03: Atif Aziz sent along code to change the culture interactively. Thanks, 
  Atif! I also took this opportunity to sort the Type field and resize the main 
  window to be a bit larger for those hard to reach format strings.

    8/6/03: Initial release (including a fix for a minimum/maximum size bug
